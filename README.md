## 💭 Why I'm Doing This Publicly

After losing my parents and supporting my siblings through university, I learned that accountability and consistency matter more than perfect circumstances. 

This repository is my commitment to:
- Build skills that create opportunities
- Document the journey for others starting from difficult places
- Create a portfolio that proves capability through action
- Stay accountable to showing up daily

Every entry here represents another step toward changing my family's trajectory.
